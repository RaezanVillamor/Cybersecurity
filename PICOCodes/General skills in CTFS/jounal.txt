Super SSH Description
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 54430 to get the flag?
You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell


Solution

raev-picoctf@webshell:~$ ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 60710
The authenticity of host '[titan.picoctf.net]:60710 ([3.139.174.234]:60710)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:4S9EbTSSRZm32I+cdM5TyzthpQryv5kudRP9PIKT7XQ.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[titan.picoctf.net]:60710' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}
Connection to titan.picoctf.net closed.
raev-picoctf@webshell:~$

Description Bases
What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

Solution: used cyberchef

Insp3ct0r
Author: zaratec/danny

Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need 
inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

Solution: used inspect element to find pieces of the flag. 
One was in html comments, one was in the css, one was in the js script

---------------------

where are the robots
Author: zaratec/Danny

Description
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

Hint:
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

Solution:
A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. 
This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. 
To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.

-add "robots.txt" to the end of the html link which will take you to a page that has a different ending html link

PW CRACK 1

solution: if you look at the python files the password is in the if statement

-----------------------------

PW crack 2

Solution: in the if statement the pw is in the if statement but in hexadecimals

---------------------------------

PW crack 3

solution: brute force

--------------------------

PW crack 4

solution: for loop brute force
---------------------------

PW crack 5

brute force but in the library. also used grep for the output tho !

python3 level5.py | grep 'pico'

------------------------------

August 21:

-Started section 5 of pico

-----------------------------

August 22:

- worked on low level binary problems

-Started on "mochis tale" --> Finished mochis tale

ASCII Numbers

Description
Convert the following string of ASCII numbers into a readable string:
0x70 0x69 0x63 0x6f 0x43 0x54 0x46 0x7b 0x34 0x35 0x63 0x31 0x31 0x5f 0x6e 0x30 0x5f 0x71 
0x75 0x33 0x35 0x37 0x31 0x30 0x6e 0x35 0x5f 0x31 0x6c 0x6c 0x5f 0x74 0x33 0x31 0x31 0x5f 
0x79 0x33 0x5f 0x6e 0x30 0x5f 0x6c 0x31 0x33 0x35 0x5f 0x34 0x34 0x35 0x64 0x34 0x31 0x38 0x30 0x7d


solution: cyberchef


--------------------------------

Picker 1

This service can provide you with a random number, but can it do anything else?
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 61475
The program's source code can be downloaded here.

Solution: run the source code but run the "win()" function, itll give you a hex code which you can put into cyberchef

Bit-O-Asm-1
Author: LT 'syreal' Jones

Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Download the assembly dump here. (Down below is whats given inside the text file)

<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
<+15>:    mov    eax,0x30
<+20>:    pop    rbp
<+21>:    ret

Solution: Right beside eax it has 0x30, deciphering that the flag it gives is picoCTF{48}  0x30 base 10 is 48

Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} 
where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Download the assembly dump here.

<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret

Solution: the ptr is 0x9fe1a so deciphering that we get 654874

Assembly Arithmetic
Arithmetic in assembly is a little different. Both operands are used in the operation, as expected, but the result of the operation is stored in the first operand,
wiping away its original contents.
The next problem introduces the imul and add instructions. imul is multiplication, the operands are multiplied together and the 
result is stored in the first operand. add is addition, the operands are added together and the result is stored in the first operand.
