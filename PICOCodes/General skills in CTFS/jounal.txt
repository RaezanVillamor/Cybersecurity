Super SSH Description
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 54430 to get the flag?
You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell
