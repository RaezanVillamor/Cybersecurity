Super SSH Description
Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.
Can you ssh as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 54430 to get the flag?
You'll also need the password 1db87a14. If asked, accept the fingerprint with yes.
If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org
If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell


Solution

raev-picoctf@webshell:~$ ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 60710
The authenticity of host '[titan.picoctf.net]:60710 ([3.139.174.234]:60710)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:4S9EbTSSRZm32I+cdM5TyzthpQryv5kudRP9PIKT7XQ.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Insp3ct0r
Author: zaratec/danny

Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need 
inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

Solution: used inspect element to find pieces of the flag. 
One was in html comments, one was in the css, one was in the js script

where are the robots
Author: zaratec/Danny

Description
Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

Hint:
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

Solution:
A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. 
This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. 
To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page.

-add "robots.txt" to the end of the html link which will take you to a page that has a different ending html link
