This excercise lets me see what happens to the ARP tables when I use the command
sudo arp -a 
on the metasploitable machine here are the results

1) ARP tables (non spoofed)
pfSense.home.arpa (192.168.1.1) at .... [ether] on eth0 



2) ARP tables (spoofed)
pfSense.home.arpa (192.168.1.1) at .... [ether] on eth0 


In both (....) the mac addresses are different. If it's spoofed then it'll show the attackers mac address
